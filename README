XMMS2-Scrobbler
===============

About
-----

XMMS2-Scrobbler is a client for XMMS2 that feeds information about the songs
you played to last.fm, formerly known as AudioScrobbler.
The latest version can be found at
http://code-monkey.de/pages/xmms2-scrobbler.


Dependencies
------------

XMMS2-Scrobbler obviously depends on libxmmsclient (ships with XMMS2).
It also depends on CURL. That's it.


Installation
------------

Run "make" to build xmms2-scrobbler.

Run "make install" to install xmms2-scrobbler. The usual variables PREFIX
and DESTDIR are evaluated.

Alternatively, just copy the bin/xmms2-scrobbler file anywhere you like.


Usage
-----

First, you need to store your Audioscrobbler username and password
in the config file:

	echo -e "user: foo\npassword: bar" > \
	        ~/.config/xmms2/clients/xmms2-scrobbler/config

Optionally, if you're behind a proxy, you'll need to tell XMMS2-Scrobbler
about that proxy:

	echo -e "proxy: my.proxy\nproxy_port: 8080" >> \
	        ~/.config/xmms2/clients/xmms2-scrobbler/config

Next, create a symlink to the script in ~/.config/xmms2/startup.d.
This will make xmms2d start xmms2-scrobbler on startup. When xmms2d is
killed, xmms2-scrobbler will exit automatically.

In case anything doesn't work as it should, have a look at
~/.config/xmms2/clients/xmms2-scrobbler/logfile.log.
