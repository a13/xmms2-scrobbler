XMMS2-Scrobbler
===============

About
-----

XMMS2-Scrobbler is a client for XMMS2 that feeds information about the songs
you played to last.fm, formerly known as AudioScrobbler.


Dependencies
------------

XMMS2-Scrobbler obviously depends on libxmmsclient (ships with XMMS2),
Ruby, and the Ruby bindings for libxmmsclient (they ship with XMMS2 as well).
In addition to this, you'll need the "event-loop" package for Ruby.
Tarballs and gems are available at
http://www.brockman.se/software/ruby-event-loop/.


Usage
-----

First, you need to store your Audioscrobbler username and password
in the config file:

	echo -e "user: foo\npassword: bar" > \
	        ~/.xmms2/clients/xmms2-scrobbler/config

Next, create a symlink to the script in ~/.xmms2/startup.d.
This will make xmms2d start xmms2-scrobbler on startup. When xmms2d is
killed, xmms2-scrobbler will exit automatically.

In case anything doesn't work as it should, have a look at
~/.xmms2/clients/xmms2-scrobbler/logfile.log.
